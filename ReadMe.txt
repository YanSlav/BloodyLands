BloodyLands
The first attempt to create something of my own.


Used free assets. It can take a long time to list them all, but the main ones are: Miziziziz, Pixel_poem dungeon tileset,
Sven Thole, Riley Gombart.

Trying to repeat (copy) a game more then 20 years old. Can you guess which one?
Original game had 17 weapons, 1 map, enemies with different color and plenty of perks that changes gameplay.


This is more of a beta version or a demo. A lot of things is missing, but originaly was planned and made: 
10 weapon variety, 8 diffrent opponents and 6 maps.
And I had to cut them out so that everything is working as intended.


All this should be ready in the final version. 


At this moment there's only 2 weapons, 3 opponents and 3 maps.
